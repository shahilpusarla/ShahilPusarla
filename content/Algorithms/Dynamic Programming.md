A Dynamic programming algorithm is a technique to solve a problem by dividing it into simpler subproblems, solving each of those just once, and storing their solutions.
Memorization is an optimization technique used to store results in a cache and return them instead of solving again when the same input occur again.
Tabulation is an approach to solve a dynamic programming problem by first filling up a table, and then compute the solution to the original problem based on the results in this table.

Memorization vs. Tabulation
If some subproblems need not be solved at all, memorization may be more efficient since only the necessary sub-problems are solved, Otherwise either of the approach should be fine.
