If I know what love is, it is because of you.
Some of us think holding on makes us strong; but sometimes it is letting go.
The truth is lived, not taught.

This book is about a young boy siddhartha who is searching for answers in life during the period of Gautam Buddha. His friend Govinda joins as a disciple of Gautam Buddha, however siddhartha continues his own journey.

"I continue my travels, not to seek other, better teachings, for i know there are none, but to depart from all teachings, teachers and to reach my goal by myself or to die."
This beautifully connects to everyone who is seeking for pre-prepared answers in life, Life is full of surprises and each individual needs to define their own path without following any advice.

"Enlightenment is being never afraid of failure and never upset by a loss"
You should always learn and never be afraid of failure or upset by a loss.

"I had to become a fool, to find Atman in me again"
Everyone in life has to go through struggles to become wise. So irrespective of the result one should never give up.

There are many more hidden answers that one will find while reading this book, As I already mentioned at the start, each individual will have their unique perspective and should not follow the advice of others, so do read this book instead of going through the reviews, you will find answers for yourself.
